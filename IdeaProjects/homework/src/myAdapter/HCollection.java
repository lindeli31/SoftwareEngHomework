/**
 * A collection represents a group of objects, known as its elements.
 * Some collections allow duplicate elements and others do not. This interface is typically used to pass collections
 * around and manipulate them where maximum generality is desired.
 *
 * <p>All general-purpose {@code HCollection} implementation classes (which typically implement {@code HCollection} indirectly
 * through one of its subinterfaces) should provide two "standard" constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor, which
 * creates an empty collection, and a constructor with a single argument of type {@code HCollection}, which creates a new
 * collection with the same elements as its argument. In effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any collection,
 * producing an equivalent collection of the desired implementation type. There is no way to enforce this convention
 * (as interfaces cannot contain constructors) but all of the general-purpose {@code HCollection} implementations in the
 * Java platform libraries comply.</p>
 *
 * <p>This implementation of {@code HCollection} is very general, meaning that different types of objects are allowed,
 * including null elements. Some collection implementations have restrictions on the elements that they may contain.
 * For example, some implementations prohibit null elements, and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.
 * Attempting to add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically {@code NullPointerException} or
 * {@code ClassCastException}. Attempting to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 * or it may simply return {@code false}; some implementations will exhibit the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter,</p>
